Recently Open AI has launched its new program called Chat GPT. Its purpose is to provide results for anything asked. A tagline for your ice-cream parlour, a code for your app or a friend for texting, Chat GPT offers it all. This indicates humans have reached the pinnacle of AI and it is time for us to rest and automate everything. Well not so early. Open AI has made a good attempt though not so successful.

Throughout history from fiction like Frankenstein, Westworld, and Terminator to real-life examples of DALL.E2, Midjourney AI and VR we have seen various attempts have been made to create a piece of machinery that will replicate humans.
Since the late 90s technology has brought humans close to each other. Though it has yet to replace them.
In recent years we have seen AI softwares with the ability to create images from text prompts you type. They are good initially. After close observation, you realize they are permutations and combinations of images that the internet has. It creates a new image so it can be said successful. When it comes to language AI falls short in many areas. The best it has done is to help use the correct syntax.

In the last five years, banks have introduced mechanical communication. Machines answer basic customer queries through chatbots. Customers understand no human is interacting with them asking 'May I help you?', but a programmed software. Questions in businesses like banking are limited, they revolve around specific topics. Chatbots continue to proliferate in businesses around question-specific topics. They are used in many places from the tourism business, hotel booking, flight ticket booking to demat account transactions. Although chatbots are useful, they cannot be used in all places. Moreover, there is no use for chatbots if you don't want to provide random information. Existing chatbots are ineffective in the creative field or the detailed information field.

For AI to create something, the machine needs to be constantly taught human interaction. As the machine learns, it will begin to anticipate human needs, expectations, and emotions, and it will communicate more accurately.

**Is Chat GPT of Open AI going to change everything? The answer is YES and NO.**

ChatGPT is a chatbot made using Artificial Intelligence (AI). GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trend Transformer,(though it is Regenerative) ChatGPT is, in simple words, software that modifies and recreates what was previously taught.
Artificial intelligence is involved in both teaching and creating changes accordingly. The human brain communicates using experience. For example, if you are asked, to describe your relationship with your family, the details of the answer will vary between the ages of five, fifteen, thirty-five and seventy. There will be similar points. However, after experiencing this feature many times, the attitude towards the details of the first trip will change. Researchers and engineers looking to develop Artificial Intelligence or Computational Intelligence are trying to give a 'feel' to a machine. The name of this sub-discipline is 'Machine Learning'. ChatGPT's importance is an advancement of all the technologies available today,
The OpenAI project is professionally implemented to ensure that a complex technology like artificial intelligence is not monopolized by any one person, region, country or company. The ChatGPT experiment is a success of the OpenAI project. It is considered to be the infancy of artificial intelligence. Given the storm, this infant project has created in the last two weeks, we can see what the upcoming years are going to be like in AI.
The purpose of ChatGPT technology is to present content to users in real-time by selecting from the information available in open form on the Internet.
